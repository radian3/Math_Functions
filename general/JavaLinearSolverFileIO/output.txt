9.4	11.0	7.0	4.2	

Now to convert this to RREF

Working on column 1 now

Dividing row 1 by 1.4 will give us:

1.0	1.5	2.143	1.429	

4.0	0.0	2.0	1.0	

9.4	11.0	7.0	4.2	

Replacing row2 with row2 - 4.0*row1 to give us:

1.0	1.5	2.143	1.429	

0.0	-6.0	-6.571	-4.714	

9.4	11.0	7.0	4.2	

Replacing row3 with row3 - 9.4*row1 to give us:

1.0	1.5	2.143	1.429	

0.0	-6.0	-6.571	-4.714	

0.0	-3.1	-13.143	-9.229	

Working on column 2 now

Dividing row 2 by -6.0 will give us:

1.0	1.5	2.143	1.429	

0.0	1.0	1.095	0.786	

0.0	-3.1	-13.143	-9.229	

Replacing row1 with row1 - 1.5*row2 to give us:

1.0	0.0	0.5	0.25	

0.0	1.0	1.095	0.786	

0.0	-3.1	-13.143	-9.229	

Replacing row3 with row3 - -3.1*row2 to give us:

1.0	0.0	0.5	0.25	

0.0	1.0	1.095	0.786	

0.0	0.0	-9.748	-6.793	

Working on column 3 now

Dividing row 3 by -9.748 will give us:

1.0	0.0	0.5	0.25	

0.0	1.0	1.095	0.786	

0.0	0.0	1.0	0.697	

Replacing row1 with row1 - 0.5*row3 to give us:

1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.098	

0.0	1.0	1.095	0.786	

0.0	0.0	1.0	0.697	

Replacing row2 with row2 - 1.095*row3 to give us:

1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.098	

0.0	1.0	0.0	0.022	

0.0	0.0	1.0	0.697	

The matrix is now in RREF. Picking off the right-most entries to give us the solution for each variable gives us:

x1 = -0.098
x2 = 0.022
x3 = 0.697
